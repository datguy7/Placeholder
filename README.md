I finalized my sales prediction project. The goal of this is project was to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

Accompanying this README file you will also find a presentation of my project and the code with my models.

My task was to:
-Analyze sales data to gain an understanding of the properties that affect sales
-Clean and prepare data
-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Develop a linear regression model to predict Item Outlet Sales
-Evaluate the model for accuracy
-Consider other predictive models
-Address methods used to improve performance
-Identify which features were most associated with higher predicted sales


My conclusions were that the features that predicted Item Outlet Sales (my target value) the most were:
Item MRP, Outlet Type Grocery Store, Item Visibility, and Item Weight 

Testing R2 and RMSE for Linear Regression model and Random Forest model were similar
Linear Regression
R2 = 58.9 RMSE = 1091.8

Random Forest
R2 = 57.6 RMSE = 1108.8
